# StartupSlam Code of Conduct

StartupSlam has a zero tolerance policy when it comes to harassment and bullying. This includes inappropriate language, inappropriate contact, harassment, discrimination, and/or anything that may lead an individual to feel excluded, uncomfortable, targeted, and/or attacked at the event. Sexual language and imagery is not tolerated at any time. 

Attendees violating this code of conduct will be asked to leave immediately and may lose access to future events hosted by Sendwithus.

### Group Agreement

This Group Agreement is a set of goals that we inspire towards, rather than a set of rules that are handed down. StartupSlam, at its core, is about achieving more and moving towards your goals.
Be friendly and patient. 
Be respectful. 
Be welcoming. StartupSlam is an inclusive and welcoming event and we want everyone to feel comfortable and safe here. So no matter what someone’s race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability we will welcome them at StartupSlam.
Words have power. StartupSlam is an event for professional development, we expect all attendees to conduct themselves as professionals, with a little bit of fun. Be kind to others, it is easy. Do not insult or put down fellow attendees. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
Violent threats or language directed against another person.
Discriminatory jokes and language.
Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
Unwelcome sexual attention.
Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, can happen at any time, StartupSlam is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements together and constructively. The strength of the Victoria tech community comes from our ability to work together well and when disagreements happen they need to be worked through. 
We all have different perspectives, skills and viewpoints. This is a strength of a community and should be utilized. Just because someone disagrees with you does not mean they are wrong. It is important to discuss the disagreement and decide on a course of action from there. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

In closing this is an event that values respect, integrity, creativity, fun, teamwork & learning to name a few. We are here to encourage learning and community building.
