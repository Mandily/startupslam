My workshop is focused on a basic introduction to the Bash command line, which is accessible by default on any Mac computer, 
or a Linux/Unix computer with Bash installed. Windows command line will not be covered. 

If you are a Windows 10 user and would like to participate in the workshop, then there are some instructions on installing 
Bash that you can follow here:

I will not be reviewing installing Bash on Windows, so come prepared!
