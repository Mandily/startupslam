### Required Tools

* Python
* Text-editor such as [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Ability to clone repos

### Get Started

* Clone [this](https://github.com/sendwithus/startupslam.git) repo
* Open up this presentations directory

### Task

Your task is to implement a "calculator" class, writing tests for all of the methods you need to impelement. This is not a "fill in the blanks" exersize and you're encouraged to be inventive and thoughtful with the tests you are writing.

### Optional Difficulties

If you are a new programmer you will want to choose the "calculator" class, which you will find in [calculator.py](calculator.py). When you can execute the [runner.py](runner.py) script and have it show a successful message you wlil know you're done.

You can implement your tests in [test_runner.py](test_runner.py) using the simple assert_equal method provided.

For a more difficult and open-ended challenge, you can implement [hard_calculator.py](hard_calculator.py) and run [hard_runner.py](hard_runner.py), though its a more open-ended excerise and you're encouraged to go as far as you can while writing good tests.

### Don't like python?

Neither do I! Feel free to do this in any language you want. This isn't being graded, its point is to encourage you to think about writing tests. What language you want to implement the "calculator" class in isn't important.
