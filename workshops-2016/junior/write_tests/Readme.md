### Task

Your task is to implement a "calculator" class, writing tests for all of the methods you need to implement. This is not a "fill in the blanks" exercise and you're encouraged to be inventive and thoughtful with the tests you are writing.

### Optional Difficulties

If you are a new programmer you will want to choose the "calculator" class, which you will find in [calculator.py](calculator.py).

You can implement your tests in [test_runner.py](test_runner.py) using the simple assert_equal method provided.

When you are finished implementing all the methods in the Calculator class, you can execute [finished_runner.py](finished_runner.py). It will either print out a success or failure message to let you know if your calculator works.

For a more difficult and open-ended challenge, you can implement [hard_calculator.py](hard_calculator.py) and run [finished_hard_runner.py](finished_hard_runner.py), though its a more open-ended exercise and you're encouraged to go as far as you can while writing good tests.

### Don't like python?

Neither do I! Feel free to do this in any language you want. This isn't being graded, its point is to encourage you to think about writing tests. What language you want to implement the "calculator" class in isn't important.
